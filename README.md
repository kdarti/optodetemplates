# Optodetemplates
This is the official location of optode template xml files, any work done on optode templates should be done through this repository.

To request access contact jorn@artinis.com (not sure if needed for github organisational repo)

There are three different .xml files in this repository:

1. Official customer (optodetemplates.xml)
2. Custom customer (optodetemplates_custom.xml)
3. Development (optodetemplates_development.xml)

The official template file (optodetemplates.xml) should only contain templates that have been cleared with (whom?) to be included in the official customer release.

Custom customer templates that were request by customers, but are of no general use and hence shouldn't be included in the official release should be put into the custom customer (optodetemplates_custom.xml) file.

Templates used for development purposes should be put into the development file (optodetemplates_development.xml).

Please go to the [wiki](https://github.com/kdarti/optodetemplates/wiki) for further information.
